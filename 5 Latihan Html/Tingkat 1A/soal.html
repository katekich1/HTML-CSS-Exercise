  <h3>Apple's iPhone 5c isn't the low-cost phone you've been 
    waiting for</h3>

  <p>
  <b>The iPhone 5c</b>, simply put, is for those who've grown numb to Apple's largely evolutionary 
  takes on its primary iPhone range. It'll attract a younger audience that cares less about finely 
  beveled edges and more about playing <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/10/iphone-5s-and-5c-cases/">Connect 4 on their iPhone case</a>. It'll cater to the same 
  <font color="green"><i>crowd that has looked</i></font> longingly towards the $599 (again, off-contract) <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/08/05/motorola-moto-x-review/">Moto X </a>-- a phone for the 
  mainstream, and a phone that's as colorful as one's soul. In a way, this is the anti-Moto X. From a 
  price, spec and feature perspective, it's a match that's too close to call. The iPhone 5c's camera 
  <font color="red">has</font> an edge on the <font color="red"><b>Moto x</b></font>, but the <i>X's Active Display</i> is a boon for notifications. As these things 
  tend to go, a lot of it boils down to ecosystem preference. The iPhone 5c is being built for the 
  same audience as the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/07/ipod-nano-review-2010/">flashy iPod nano</a>, and moreover, Apple built it for those on <u>Wall Street</u>
  who feel that it simply <i>must</i> attract new markets to stay atop its game.
 <b><hr></b> <br>
 Apple never showed intentions of racing the <u><b>Nexus 7 </b></u>to the bottom in the tablet game, and the 
 <i><b>iPhone 5c</b></i> is proof that it won't do that in the phone arena, either.
